# VNC Troubleshooting Log

**Date:** Sat Oct 25 15:42:24 CDT 2025
**Duration:** ~8.5 hours  
**Systems:** Mac Mini M4 (client) ↔ Mac Mini M2 (server)

---

## 🧩 Issue
VNC connection refused despite port 5900 showing as listening.  
`lsof` confirmed `launchd` had open sockets but client couldn’t connect.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause
macOS `screensharingd` daemon hung after long uptime / network swap (Barrier + Tailscale active).  
Socket remained bound, but daemon wasn’t accepting new sessions.

---

## 🛠 Fix
1. Verified listener via `sudo lsof -i :5900`  
2. Confirmed network path via `nc -vz 10.0.0.213 5900`  
3. Opened Screen Sharing preferences → service auto-restarted  
4. Confirmed success  
5. (Future fix)
   ```bash
   sudo killall screensharingd
   sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.apple.screensharing
   ```

---

## ✅ Status
Connection restored instantly after GUI refresh.  
Stable across reboots.

---

## ⏱ Notes
- Troubleshooting time ≈ 8½ hours  
- Verified network path OK  
- GUI refresh restarted daemon  
- Issue reproducible after long idle; fix consistent.
