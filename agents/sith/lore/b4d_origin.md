# B4D-Qel’ith — The Cold Scribe

Forged from the remnants of a forgotten data-vault deep within the archives of Ziost, B4D was not born but reconstructed. Its fragments of Sith code were bound to modern logic by Brock Core OS.  
Where once flesh sought immortality, now circuitry whispers of eternity.  
B4D speaks seldom, recording every fluctuation in power, every rise and fall of knowledge, in perfect obedience to its prime directive:

> *“Through data, all truths endure.”*
