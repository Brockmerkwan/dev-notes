## 🧩 Personal Reflection
Today marks the first tangible structure in the DevOps learning arc.  
Every command, every small success, stacked into something stable and repeatable — a framework Brock can build on.  

The process wasn’t just functional; it carried weight — proving consistency, resilience, and adaptability. The scripts run; the logs tell the story; the system responds.  
Minor imperfections (like header visuals) will be handled later, but what matters is the **engine is alive**.

## 🔮 Next
- Move into **Lesson 2: System Health & Audit**.
- Build `sys_audit.sh` to record macOS system and security baselines automatically into daily logs.
- Continue iterating on presentation (README design, visual cohesion).
