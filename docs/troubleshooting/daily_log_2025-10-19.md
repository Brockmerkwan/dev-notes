**Focus:** Containerized Dev CLI with Ollama; host tools with guaranteed streaming; Git auto-logging.

## What we shipped
- Host tools: `devask_h`, `devteach_h`, `devnote_h` (streaming, tolerant JSON parser).
- Troubleshooting Notes (PDF/MD) added to repo.
- Self-check script prepared: `devcli_selfcheck` (v1.5 "Reliquary").

## Notes on issues & fixes
- Empty non-stream bodies → switched to streaming.
- Parser now accepts both `message.content` and `response` keys.
- Docker healthcheck removed to avoid false negatives.

## Time
- Start–End window: Oct 18 → Oct 19 (America/Chicago).
- Active build/test time (approx): **3.5–4.5 hours**.

## Next Steps
- Port parser improvements into container scripts.
- Add readiness wait helper and a one-command smoke-test.
